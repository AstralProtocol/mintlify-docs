# Location Proofs

Location proofs provide **evidence-backed verification** of geographic position. Rather than simply trusting GPS coordinates, location proofs combine multiple independent evidence sources to increase confidence that a claimed location is accurate.

## The Problem

GPS is spoofable. Any system that trusts raw coordinates from a device is vulnerable to location fraud. For high-value use cases — financial transactions, regulatory compliance, access control — we need stronger guarantees about where something actually is.

## The Location Proof Framework

Location proofs address this through a layered approach:

1. **Evidence Collection** — Gather location signals from multiple independent sources
2. **Artifact Signing** — Bundle the evidence into a signed, tamper-evident artifact
3. **Evidence Evaluation** — Analyze the evidence to determine confidence in the claimed location

This creates a spectrum of assurance levels. More corroborating evidence from diverse sources increases confidence. The appropriate level depends on the use case — a check-in at a coffee shop has different requirements than cross-border financial compliance.

## Evidence Categories

The framework supports multiple categories of location evidence, each with different trust properties:

| Category | Examples | Trust Properties |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Network Signals** | Wi-Fi networks, cell towers, Bluetooth beacons | Hard to spoof at scale, reveals approximate area |
| **Satellite Systems** | GPS, GLONASS, Galileo | Globally available, but spoofable |
| **Network Measurements** | RTT latency, signal strength | Physical constraints limit spoofing |
| **Sensor Data** | Accelerometer, barometer, camera | Environmental context, harder to fabricate |
| **Delegated** | Ride-share logs, utility records, purchase history | Third-party corroboration |
| **Social** | Peer attestations, community validation | Reputation-based verification |

No single evidence source is definitive. The power comes from combining multiple independent sources that would be difficult to spoof simultaneously.

## Location Proof Plugins

Different environments require different approaches to evidence collection. A mobile phone has access to GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular signals. A server in a data center has different signals available — network topology, IP geolocation, potentially hardware attestation.

Location proof **plugins** handle evidence collection for specific contexts:

- Different **device types** (mobile, desktop, server, IoT)
- Different **environments** (consumer, enterprise, infrastructure)
- Different **security requirements** (casual check-in vs. regulatory compliance)
- Different **privacy requirements** (anonymous vs. identity-linked)

We are launching with two initial plugins:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User Device Plugin" icon="mobile">
    For mobile and desktop applications. Collects evidence from device sensors, network signals, and environmental context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Infrastructure Plugin" icon="server">
    For servers, nodes, and autonomous agents. Collects evidence from network topology, hosting environment, and operational context.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Additional plugins for specialized contexts will follow.

## The Verification Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Evidence Collection">
    The appropriate plugin gathers location evidence from available sources on the device or infrastructure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Artifact Creation">
    Evidence is bundled into a location proof artifact and signed by the subject
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evidence Evaluation">
    The **Astral Verify** module analyzes the evidence, checking consistency and assigning confidence scores
  </Step>
  <Step title="Policy Application">
    The verified location feeds into Astral's geospatial policy engine for onchain actions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Astral Verify** is the evidence evaluation component currently in development. It applies configurable rules to assess evidence quality and detect potential spoofing attempts.

## Confidence Levels

Not all location proofs are equal. The framework produces confidence assessments based on:

- **Evidence diversity** — How many independent sources corroborate the location?
- **Evidence quality** — How reliable are the individual sources?
- **Consistency** — Do the sources agree with each other?
- **Recency** — How fresh is the evidence?

Applications can set minimum confidence thresholds appropriate to their risk tolerance.

## Infrastructure Location Proofs

While most location verification focuses on **users** (where is this person?), infrastructure location proofs answer a different question: **where is this compute running?**

### Why Infrastructure Location Matters

- **Data Sovereignty** — Regulations like GDPR require data processing within specific jurisdictions
- **Decentralization Verification** — Prove that validators, sequencers, or nodes actually run in diverse locations
- **Latency Guarantees** — Verify that infrastructure operates where promised
- **Regulatory Compliance** — Auditable evidence for financial services, healthcare, and other regulated industries

### Infrastructure vs. User Proofs

| Aspect | User Location | Infrastructure Location |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Subject** | Human with a device | Server, node, agent, or autonomous service |
| **Frequency** | Per-action | Continuous or periodic |
| **Evidence Sources** | Device sensors, network signals | Network topology, hosting metadata, operational context |
| **Use Cases** | Geofenced apps, POAPs, local currencies | Data sovereignty, validator distribution, sequencer location |

### Multi-Region Proofs

Some applications require proof that infrastructure is distributed across multiple geographic regions — for redundancy, decentralization, or regulatory reasons.

Multi-region proofs verify that a system operates nodes in distinct locations simultaneously. This is particularly relevant for:

- **Validator sets** requiring geographic distribution
- **Sequencers** with backup nodes in different regions
- **Data processing** that must span multiple jurisdictions
- **High-availability systems** with geographic redundancy requirements

The infrastructure plugin supports collecting and coordinating evidence across multiple deployment locations to produce unified multi-region attestations.

## Integration with Astral

Location proofs plug into the broader Astral Location Services pipeline:

```
Location Proof ──► Astral Verify ──► Location Record ──► Policy Engine ──► Onchain Action
   (evidence)      (evaluation)       (attestation)      (computation)      (resolver)
```

Once evidence is evaluated and a location record is created, it can be used with all existing Astral geospatial operations — distance checks, containment queries, and policy attestations that trigger smart contract logic.

## What's Next

Location proof plugins and the Astral Verify module are in active development. Code examples and integration guides will be released as the components become available.
