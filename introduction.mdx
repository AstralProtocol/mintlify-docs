# What is Astral Location Services?

Astral Location Services is a **verifiable geospatial computation oracle** that makes location-based smart contracts possible on Ethereum.

Think of it as **PostGIS for Ethereum** — we provide spatial operations (distance, containment, intersection) that run in a trusted execution environment and produce signed attestations you can verify onchain.

## The Core Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Location Data] --> B[Astral Service]
    B --> C[Spatial Computation]
    C --> D[Signed Attestation]
    D --> E[Smart Contract]
    E --> F[Onchain Action]
```

1. **Input**: Location attestations (EAS format) or raw GeoJSON
2. **Processing**: Geospatial computations in a verifiable environment (TEE)
3. **Output**: Signed Policy Attestations usable offchain and onchain

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { AstralSDK } from '@decentralized-geo/astral-sdk';

const astral = new AstralSDK({ chainId: 84532 });

// Check if user is within 500m of a landmark
const result = await astral.compute.within(
  userLocationUID,
  landmarkUID,
  500,  // meters
  { schema: RESOLVER_SCHEMA, recipient: userAddress }
);

console.log(`Nearby: ${result.result}`);

// Submit onchain (developer pays gas, Astral is attester)
if (result.result) {
  const tx = await astral.eas.submitDelegated(result.delegatedAttestation);
}
```

## Why Astral?

### The Problem

Smart contracts can't verify real-world location. GPS is spoofable. Oracles are centralized. There's no trustworthy way to gate onchain actions by physical presence.

### The Solution

Astral provides:

- **Verifiable computation** — Operations run in a TEE, not a black box
- **Composable results** — Signed attestations that any contract can verify
- **Familiar patterns** — EAS resolvers make integration natural
- **Complement, don't replace** — Use Turf.js for UX, Astral for verification

## Architecture Overview

```
Developer App → Astral SDK → Compute Service (EigenCompute TEE) → Policy Attestation
                                     ↓
                              PostGIS (in-container)
```

The compute service runs inside EigenCompute's TEE environment with PostGIS embedded in the container, enabling verifiable geospatial computation with no external dependencies.
