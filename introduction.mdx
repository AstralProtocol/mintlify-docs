# What is Astral Location Services?

Astral Location Services is a **geospatial policy engine** that connects location-based logic to smart contracts on Ethereum.

We provide spatial operations (distance, containment, intersection) that run in a trusted execution environment and produce signed attestations you can use to trigger onchain actions.

## The Core Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Location Data] --> B[Geospatial Policy Engine]
    B --> C[Signed Attestation]
    C --> D[Smart Contract]
    D --> E[Onchain Action]
```

1. **Input**: Location attestations (EAS format) or raw GeoJSON
2. **Processing**: Geospatial computations in a verifiable environment (TEE)
3. **Output**: Signed Policy Attestations usable offchain and onchain

## Quick Example

<Note>
  **Code snippets need testing** — Examples show the intended API. Verify against the actual implementation before use.
</Note>

```typescript
import { AstralClient } from '@decentralized-geo/astral-compute';

const astral = new AstralClient({ chainId: 84532 });

// Check if user is within 500m of a landmark
const result = await astral.compute.within({
  geometry: userLocationUID,
  target: landmarkUID,
  radius: 500,  // meters
  chainId: 84532,
  schema: RESOLVER_SCHEMA,
  recipient: userAddress
});

console.log(`Nearby: ${result.result}`);

// Submit onchain (developer pays gas, Astral is attester)
if (result.result) {
  const tx = await astral.eas.submitDelegated(result.delegatedAttestation);
}
```

## Why Astral?

### The Problem

Smart contracts can't natively perform geospatial computations. Even if you have location data, there's no way to check "is this point inside this polygon?" or "how far apart are these two locations?" in a way that produces verifiable results for onchain use.

### The Solution

Astral provides the **geospatial computation layer** — the middle piece of the puzzle:

- **Verifiable computation** — Operations run in a TEE, not a black box
- **Composable results** — Signed attestations that any contract can verify
- **Familiar patterns** — EAS resolvers make integration natural
- **Complement, don't replace** — Use Turf.js for UX, Astral for verification

<Info>
  **What about location verification?** GPS is spoofable, and verifying *where* a user actually is remains an open problem. We're developing the [Location Proof framework](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/towards-stronger-location-proofs/5323) to address this. Astral Location Services provides the geospatial policy layer that location proofs will plug into.

## Architecture Overview

```
Developer App → Astral SDK → Geospatial Policy Engine (TEE) → Policy Attestation
                                        ↓
                                 PostGIS (in-container)
```

The geospatial policy engine runs inside EigenCompute's TEE environment with PostGIS embedded in the container, enabling verifiable geospatial computation with no external dependencies.
