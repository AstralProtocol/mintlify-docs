# Agent Location Verification

As autonomous agents become more prevalent — AI agents, trading bots, automated services, IoT devices — there's growing need to verify **where** these agents operate. This guide covers how agents use the location proof framework to attest their geographic position.

## Why Agent Location Matters

### Regulatory Compliance

AI agents processing financial data may need to prove they run in licensed jurisdictions. Healthcare agents must demonstrate they operate within HIPAA-compliant regions. Data sovereignty requirements increasingly apply to automated systems, not just human users.

### Trust and Transparency

Users interacting with agents want assurance about where their data is processed. A European user may require that an AI agent handling their request operates within the EU. Location proofs provide verifiable transparency.

### Service Level Agreements

Agents promising regional availability or low-latency access can prove they actually run in promised locations, not in distant data centers claiming otherwise.

### Jurisdictional Operations

Some automated operations are only legal in specific locations. An agent must prove it operates from an authorized jurisdiction before executing restricted actions.

## The Agent Location Flow

Agents use the **infrastructure plugin** to collect location evidence and produce proofs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Evidence Collection">
    The infrastructure plugin gathers location evidence from the agent's operating environment — network topology, hosting metadata, latency measurements, and other contextual signals
  </Step>
  <Step title="Artifact Signing">
    The agent bundles the collected evidence into a location proof artifact and signs it with its identity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evidence Evaluation">
    **Astral Verify** analyzes the evidence, checking for consistency and assigning confidence scores based on evidence quality and diversity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Location Record Creation">
    If evaluation passes, a verified location record is created that can be used with Astral's geospatial policy engine
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Evidence Sources for Agents

Unlike mobile devices with GPS and cellular signals, server-based agents have different evidence available:

| Evidence Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Network Topology** | Traceroute data, AS paths, peering relationships |
| **Hosting Metadata** | Cloud provider region, availability zone, data center identifiers |
| **Latency Measurements** | Round-trip times to known geographic reference points |
| **IP Geolocation** | Location data associated with the agent's IP address |
| **Operational Context** | Deployment configuration, infrastructure provider attestations |

The infrastructure plugin collects and packages these signals. Multiple corroborating sources increase confidence in the claimed location.

## Periodic Verification

Unlike user location proofs (typically one-time, per-action), agent location often requires **continuous or periodic verification**. An agent that proved its location yesterday might have migrated today.

Agents can maintain fresh location proofs by:

- Collecting evidence on a regular schedule
- Refreshing proofs before they expire
- Responding to on-demand verification requests

The appropriate frequency depends on the use case. High-security applications may require hourly verification, while others might accept daily or weekly proofs.

## Multi-Region Agents

Some agent deployments span multiple geographic regions for redundancy, load balancing, or regulatory reasons. Multi-region proofs verify that an agent system operates across distinct locations simultaneously.

This is relevant for:

- **Distributed agent networks** requiring geographic diversity
- **Failover configurations** with agents in multiple regions
- **Regulatory requirements** mandating presence in specific jurisdictions
- **Decentralization guarantees** proving no single geographic point of failure

The infrastructure plugin can coordinate evidence collection across multiple deployment locations to produce unified multi-region attestations.

## Integration with Policy Engine

Once an agent has a verified location proof, it can participate in location-gated operations:

- Prove compliance with jurisdictional requirements before executing sensitive operations
- Demonstrate geographic distribution as part of decentralization guarantees
- Satisfy data sovereignty requirements for processing user data
- Meet SLA commitments about regional availability

The verified location feeds into Astral's geospatial policy engine, enabling the same spatial operations available to user location proofs — containment checks, distance calculations, and policy attestations.

## Security Considerations

Agent location verification faces unique challenges:

- **No GPS** — Servers lack the positioning hardware available on mobile devices
- **Virtualization** — Cloud infrastructure can obscure physical location
- **Migration** — Agents can move between regions, requiring fresh proofs
- **Collusion** — Hosting providers could potentially assist in location spoofing

The multi-source evidence approach addresses these by requiring corroboration across independent signals. Evidence diversity makes comprehensive spoofing significantly harder.

## What's Next

The infrastructure plugin and agent verification workflows are in active development. Code examples and integration guides will be released as the components become available.
