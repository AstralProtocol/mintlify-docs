# Roadmap

Astral Location Services is being built as part of the EigenLayer Open Innovation Program. This page tracks what's done, what we're working on, and what's planned.

## Current Status

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specification" icon="check">
    Complete technical specification defining architecture, API, SDK, and schemas
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation" icon="spinner">
    Building the compute service, SDK extensions, and example contracts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing" icon="circle">
    Integration testing with EigenCompute and EAS
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch" icon="circle">
    Testnet deployment and public launch
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Planned Features

### Phase 1: MVP

- [ ] Core operations: `distance`, `contains`, `within`, `intersects`, `area`, `length`
- [ ] PostGIS-powered computations
- [ ] EigenCompute TEE deployment
- [ ] Delegated attestation signing
- [ ] SDK with compute namespace
- [ ] Basic rate limiting (IP-based)

### Phase 2: Authentication

- [ ] Wallet-based request signing
- [ ] Per-wallet rate limiting
- [ ] Higher limits for authenticated users

### Phase 3: Extended Operations

- [ ] `buffer` - Create buffer zone around geometry
- [ ] `centroid` - Find center point
- [ ] `union` - Merge geometries
- [ ] `intersection` - Overlapping area
- [ ] `disjoint` - Geometries don't touch

### Phase 4: Location Proofs

- [ ] Multi-stamp location verification
- [ ] GPS time series analysis
- [ ] Accelerometer pattern matching
- [ ] NFC/QR physical proof integration

### Phase 5: Decentralization

- [ ] AVS consensus (multiple operators)
- [ ] Cryptoeconomic security
- [ ] ZK proof generation (optional)
- [ ] Decentralized signer rotation

## What's Missing (MVP)

These are explicitly **out of scope** for the MVP:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Location proof verification | Deferred | Stamps/verification is separate workstream |
| Gas sponsorship | Deferred | Developers pay via delegated attestations |
| Reference data caching | Deferred | Start stateless, add if needed |
| Complex geometry limits | Deferred | Add based on usage patterns |
| Cross-chain operations | Not planned | Single chain per SDK instance |
| Unit conversion | Not planned | Metric only |

---

## Research Questions

These are open questions being investigated:

1. **Nonce/Replay Protection**
   - Should Policy Attestations include explicit nonce?
   - Current design relies on unique UIDs + timestamps

2. **EigenCompute Networking**
   - Verify TEE allows outbound for EAS queries
   - Understand latency characteristics

3. **PostGIS in TEE**
   - Validate performance in TEE environment
   - Benchmark spatial operations
