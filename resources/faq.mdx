# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Astral Location Services?">
    Astral Location Services is a verifiable geospatial computation oracle for Ethereum. It runs spatial operations (distance, containment, intersection) in a trusted execution environment and produces signed attestations you can verify onchain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from a regular oracle?">
    Unlike traditional oracles that report external data, Astral performs **computation** on location data and signs the results. The computation runs in a TEE (EigenCompute), providing cryptographic proof that the operation was performed correctly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What can I build with this?">
    Any application that needs to gate onchain actions by physical location:
    - Proof-of-visit NFTs
    - Local currencies (geofenced token swaps)
    - Neighborhood DAOs
    - Delivery verification
    - Location-based games

    See [Use Cases](/use-cases) for detailed examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this production ready?">
    No. Astral Location Services is under active development. APIs may change. We're building in public and welcome feedback!
  </Accordion>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What spatial operations are supported?">
    **MVP operations:**
    - `distance` - Distance between two geometries (meters)
    - `contains` - Is geometry B inside geometry A?
    - `within` - Is point within radius of target?
    - `intersects` - Do geometries overlap?
    - `area` - Area of a polygon (square meters)
    - `length` - Length of a line (meters)

    **Future operations:**
    - `buffer`, `centroid`, `union`, `intersection`, `disjoint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What chains are supported?">
    MVP targets **Base Sepolia** (chain ID 84532). Additional chains (Base Mainnet, Ethereum Sepolia/Mainnet) are planned.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does verification work?">
    1. Operations run in EigenCompute's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
    2. The TEE attests that specific code executed on specific inputs
    3. Results are signed with a key held inside the TEE
    4. Smart contracts verify `attestation.attester == astralSigner`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the trust model?">
    **MVP:** Centralized service with TEE execution attestation. Trust Astral + TEE.

    **Future:** AVS consensus (multiple operators), ZK proofs, decentralized signing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can users spoof their GPS?">
    Yes. Astral verifies that **computations are correct**, not that **inputs are authentic**. If a user provides a fake GPS coordinate, we'll compute on that fake coordinate.

    Future: Location proofs with multiple corroborating stamps will make spoofing harder.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to run my own service?">
    No. Astral operates the compute service. You just use the SDK to call it and submit attestations to your contracts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who pays gas?">
    You do. The delegated attestation pattern means:
    - Astral signs the attestation offchain
    - You submit with Astral's signature (paying gas)
    - EAS records Astral as the attester

    This lets you control costs and timing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this without submitting onchain?">
    Yes. Policy Attestations are signed offchain and can be used in your application directly. Onchain submission is optional.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I verify in my smart contract?">
    Use an EAS resolver:
    ```solidity
    function onAttest(Attestation calldata attestation, uint256)
        internal override returns (bool)
    {
        require(attestation.attester == astralSigner, "Not from Astral");
        (bool result, , , ) = abi.decode(attestation.data, (bool, bytes32[], uint64, string));
        require(result, "Location check failed");
        // ... your logic
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the relationship to Turf.js?">
    Complementary!
    - **Turf.js**: Client-side, instant, free, unverified
    - **Astral**: Server-side, verified, signed attestation

    Use Turf for UX (showing distance in real-time), use Astral for verification (proving location for onchain actions).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What coordinate format do you use?">
    GeoJSON standard: **[longitude, latitude]** in WGS84 (EPSG:4326).

    ```typescript
    // San Francisco
    const sf = { type: 'Point', coordinates: [-122.4194, 37.7749] };
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What units are results in?">
    Metric only:
    - Distance/length: **meters**
    - Area: **square meters**
    - Radius (in `within`): **meters**

    No unit conversion options. Convert client-side if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use raw GeoJSON or do I need attestations?">
    Both work! You can pass:
    - Attestation UIDs (verified, traceable)
    - Raw GeoJSON (unverified, for reference data or prototyping)

    For security-sensitive operations, prefer attestation UIDs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where is data stored?">
    - **Location attestations**: On EAS (onchain) or IPFS/your storage (offchain)
    - **Policy attestations**: Returned to you; optionally submitted to EAS
    - **Compute service**: Stateless, no persistent storage
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
