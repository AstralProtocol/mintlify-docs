# Intersects

Check if two geometries intersect (share any portion of space).

```
POST /compute/v0/intersects
```

## Request Body

<ParamField body="geometry1" type="Input" required>
  First geometry to check.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="geometry2" type="Input" required>
  Second geometry to check.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="schema" type="string" required>
  EAS schema UID to issue the attestation against.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="recipient" type="string">
  Ethereum address to receive the attestation.
</ParamField>

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.astral.global/compute/v0/intersects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "geometry1": "0xpolygon1...",
    "geometry2": "0xpolygon2...",
    "schema": "0xschema...",
    "recipient": "0xdef456..."
  }'
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "result": true,
  "operation": "intersects",
  "timestamp": 1706400000,
  "inputRefs": [
    "0xpolygon1...",
    "0xpolygon2..."
  ],
  "attestation": { ... },
  "delegatedAttestation": { ... }
}
```

## Notes

- Uses PostGIS `ST_Intersects` function
- Returns `true` if geometries share any space (including boundaries)
- More permissive than `contains` — touching boundaries count as intersection
